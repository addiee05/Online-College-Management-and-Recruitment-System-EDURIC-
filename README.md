# Online-College-Management-and-Recruitment-System-EDURIC-

EDURIC is an intermediary platform that simplifies the college admission and staff recruitment process in India.
It serves as a communication bridge between students/teachers and colleges, much like an off-campus recruitment/exam platform.
Rather than directly managing internal college databases, EDURIC:
Collects student and teacher applications.
Forwards them to relevant colleges.
Receives and displays status updates to the applicants.
This ensures that users have a centralized platform to track applications without navigating multiple portals.
